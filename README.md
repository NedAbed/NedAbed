## Hi, I'm Nedjm Eddine Abed

📱 **Mobile Developer & UX/UI Designer**

I’m an independent mobile developer and UX/UI designer focused on building clean, scalable mobile applications with **React Native**. I enjoy taking projects from idea and design to fully functional products, paying close attention to user experience, performance, and code quality.

My projects are built from the ground up — starting with planning and UI/UX design, then implementing frontend logic, state management, and backend integration as I grow toward full-stack mobile development.
